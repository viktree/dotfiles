[mac/sponz](https://github.com/viktree/dotfiles/tree/mac/sponz) is my personal m1 mac book air that I use for most things.

This dotfiles repo is my preferred way to back up and syncing my settings/configurations across multiple machines. I often discover helpful settings or programming gems while toying around and it's great to have them nestled within the confines of this repo.
